    "In this Jupyter notebook are contained the short answers/invocations of appropriate code in response to the assignment components of the challenge in question. However, most of the long-winded implementation is hidden away in `.py` files we wrote, that are imported here. Thus, for this to work, it is recommended you clone the entirety of [our associated Github repo](https://github.com/DanielShteinbok/CANSOFCOM_Drone_2021), and opening the Jupyter notebook contained within that (it's this one, but its location within the repo simply ensures that local imports work properly with minimal troubleshooting).\n",
